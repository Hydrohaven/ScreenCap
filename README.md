# ScreenCap
Simple bulk file renamer that follows a "[name] [number]" file naming format (Josh 1, Josh 2, Josh 3, etc). 

# Installation
Coming out soon! I'm able to package it as an exe but I have yet to set up releases on GitHub!

# Usage
Users enter a name and starting number to increment from in the two text boxes at the top.\
\
6 distinct commands are offered to the user assigned to different keybinds:
- Pressing **C** takes a screenshot of the main monitor, typically used for taking rapid pictures of the main monitor (requires the app to be on another monitor)
- Pressing **R** renames all files inside the current directory using the set name and number.
- Pressing **E** converts all files based on the set file format using the app's top left (name) box. Users must make sure to include the period in a file format (e.g. Enter ".png" on the top left box)
- Pressing **F** prompts the user to select a new directory to work in.
- Pressing **L** prints the latest file in the directory, allowing users to check if renaming or converting files was successful.
- Pressing **H** stands for **H**elp, reprinting the directions users are greeted with when first opening the app.

# Disclaimer
This app was made in the Winter break of my Senior year in High School and is thus not the prettiest application. But it holds a special place in my heart regardless as it was my 2nd app ever created through my self-taught Java GUI days (I do not want to go back...)\
Because it was made such a long time ago, there might be bugs here and there so be careful if you ever actually use this!\
\
**Side Note:** File format conversion with the "E" command doesn't ACTUALLY convert files **correctly**, all it does is rename the file extension from .jpeg to .png and so on...
